# Minerva-Capstone
This repo contains the code notebook used to generate results for my Capstone project at Minerva Schools. 
This project is about distinguishing between the two mutational subtypes of the EGFR mutation, exon 19 deletions 
and exon 21 substitution, with whole slide images using deep learning (Inception V3). 

The patient_list.csv file contains the list of patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions and exon 21 substituions in 
Cancer Genome Atlas's LUAD project.
